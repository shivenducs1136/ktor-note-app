# KtorNoteApp

# What Will You Do in this Course?
You will implement your very own backend server with the powerful Ktor framework. After implementing the backend side, you will create a note app on Android to connect it to your server. Users will be able to register and login in your app to create notes and synchronize them on your server. All the notes will also be cached in a local database on the device for offline access. Users will be able to add owners to their notes, so that they can share their notes with other users who are then allowed to also read and edit these notes.
